💗 This is my first ever coding experience!

👩‍💻 I completed CFG's Web development coding kickstarter course in Jan 2024.

🌐 We were tasked to create and link basic HTML pages with CSS and basic JavaScript elements in a group.

🥐 The page I created contains information about bakeries in East London.

💻 We covered:
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- UX and UI
